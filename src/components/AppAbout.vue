    <p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Use what you see, don't plan it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>
    <p>Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can do anything your heart can imagine. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. The least little bit can do so much. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.</p>
    <p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</p>
    <p>We'll make some happy little bushes here. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>
    <p>See there, told you that would be easy. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let the paint work. It takes dark in order to show light. You can do it. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
